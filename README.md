# ConvLSTM-for-Sign-Language-Recognition
In this notebook, I have created Sign Language Recognition model using ConvLSTM1D.To build an efficient training pipeline, I have used TFRecord Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lonnieqin/islr-12-time-steps-tfrecords created by notebook https://www.kaggle.com/code/lonnieqin/islr-create-tfrecord for training.
